## Implementation Details
### **React Components**
- **App Component (`App.js`)**:
  - Manages state for recipes and search input.
  - Calls the Edamam API to fetch recipe data.
  - Displays the search bar and renders the Recipe components.

- **Recipe Component (`Recipe.js`)**:
  - Accepts props to display recipe details (title, image, ingredients).
  - Uses CSS Modules for styling.

### **CSS Styling**
- **App.css**
  - Styles the main app layout and search form.
  - Uses a modern, responsive design approach.
- **Recipe.module.css**
  - Styles individual recipe cards with borders and shadows.
  - Ensures a visually appealing UI.

## Testing and Performance Monitoring
- **Testing**
  - Uses `@testing-library/react` to test React components.
  - Ensures the search functionality and rendering are working correctly.
- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Implements Web Vitals to measure and optimize load times and responsiveness.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates React development skills, including state management, API integration, and testing. The Recipe Finder app provides a practical implementation of functional components, efficient styling, and real-world API handling.
